                I ended up finding my future career by mistake! 
    
                When I first started attending Utah State University, I wanted to major in computer 
                engineering. I love building computers as a hobby and wanted to know everything about them. 
                So my first semester I took a class that I thought was a part of computer engineering program. 
                <br><br>
                Well, it wasn't...
                <br><br>
                It was actually a part of the computer science program. When I first found out that I took the 
                wrong class, I was a little dumbfounded that I had taken the wrong class, but I wasn't 
                disappointed; I found that I had a passion for coding. I switched majors to computer science 
                the following semester, and have never regretted my choice for a second. Throughout college, I 
                have taken courses in algorithms and data structures, networking, cloud computing, web and 
                mobile development, and I even managed to fit in some math and technical writing classes along 
                the way.
                <br><br>
                As a sophomore, I was given the opportunity to work for Utah State University as an undergraduate 
                research assistant on a Road Weather Information System research project. I worked on a 
                team of 4 with 2 developers and 2 engineers to install and test the RWIS software on to new 
                hardware, and develop, maintain, and test alert scripts using sensor data from the RWIS.
                <br><br>
    
                Now as a Senior, I am currently working as an Intern at Rent Dynamics, a software company here 
                in Logan, Utah. I absolutely love working here and am learning so much, including how to apply the 
                things I have learned in school to real-life situations.
