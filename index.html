                My name is Michael Harrop and I am an Intern for Rent Dynamics. I graduate from 
                Utah State University with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in December of 2021.
                I have been married to my beautiful wife, Danielle Harrop, for 5 years and we just had 
                a beautiful baby girl in May 2021. I love being a father and a husband, and I am so excited 
                to see where life takes me once I graduate!
